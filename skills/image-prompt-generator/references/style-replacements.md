| Makoto Shinkai style | hyper-detailed photorealistic anime backgrounds, cinematic sky art, layered atmospheric lighting |
| Ufotable style | dynamic action cinematography, high-contrast lighting, fluid animation quality |
| MAPPA style | bold modern anime aesthetic, high-contrast dramatic lighting |
| Kyoto Animation style | soft pastel lighting, detailed character acting, warm atmospheric anime |
| Wit Studio style | cinematic wide shots, detailed linework, dramatic action choreography |
| A-1 Pictures style | clean modern anime aesthetic, balanced detail, polished character designs |
| Trigger style | exaggerated perspective, bold colors, high-energy dynamic poses |

## What to Avoid in prompt.md

- Studio names (Ghibli, MAPPA, Ufotable, Bones, etc.)
- Director/artist names (Shinkai, Miyazaki, etc.)
- Anime/game IP names (Naruto, Genshin Impact, etc.)
- Software-specific model names (animagine, Counterfeit, etc.)
